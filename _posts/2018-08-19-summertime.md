I just cried. A real snot-nosed cry.

My ex told me she was no longer interested in any but friendship because she's interested in other people.

She'd been my ex for 8 months. We'd dated for 3 or so years.

I broke up with her, and felt mostly fine after. My previous post explains that in more detail as to why I was doing ok.

I couldn't handle being told I wasn't needed. It invalidated me. And I got upset, mostly at myself and the feeling of loss and jealousy I felt. But I also got upset at her, probably for some freudian reason


The more I unpack my feelings the more I suspect it also has a lot to do with having sex with her again.

There's something fun and nice about ex sex, but our doubts with it was best, but perhaps paradoxically, expressed by her question before a tryst once - "Should we do it just because it's fun and easy?". Generally? Probably yes.

Why didn't it work out for us? Or rather, me? I thought we could have casual sex. After all, I had spent the last 8 months
