## Show Me Yours I'll Show You Mine

I talk about myself a lot. While this exposes a narcissistic streak more than anything else it allows me to expose my vulnerabilities to people. I've found over the past couple of years that exploring this side of self-expression was most directly responsible for my recent, sharp growth in ambition, self-esteem and risk-taking.

I've been an advocate of a "you show me yours I'll show you mine" approach to gut-spilling for half a decade but it's only been recently that I've made a conscious effort to show mine as *early* and *often* as possible. I've been exploring a few different routes of self-exposure mostly including divulging my insecurities to acquaintances and being as upfront as I can be during moments of social or general anxiety. I try also to talk about my stint in anxiety and self-esteem therapy, whether to proselytize on therapy's behalf or purely to expose myself further.

The result I've found is unilateral respect from my peers and a stronger connection with friends. 

I've had a rep as a "therapist" friend for as long as I can remember. This role bore me a sizable burden - to be someone's source of comfort for things they often needed professional help for. But it also lent me a certain power - I was expected to share my weakness only to the extent that it furthered my advice-giving, usually in the form of anecdotes describing my surmounting analogous challenges or an 'I relate to you too!' sentiment. Shedding this role I lost both the burden and the power: my dynamic with most now shifting to one of even-keeled friendship with a mutual exchange of support and emotional intimacy. My support network has grown dramatically over the past year.

But I have ways to go. 

What I find I do more often than I'd like is a more disconnected, post-resolution sharing of my difficulties, where I placidly or jokingly share my struggles in a highly analytical or disimpassioned sense, sans the emotional content of the feeling I'm exploring.

## Case in Point

The other day I was confronted with a feeling of jealousy and possessiveness over my ex-girlfriend. 

I noticed some genuinely friendly social media comments between her and the ambigiously gendered profile of another. I obsessively tried to determine this other person's gender to determine if I should be worried about some flirtatious thing happening (between them and someone with whom I have no right to be possessive over!).

It took me a couple minutes too long to stop and laugh at myself at what was happening. I had been hanging out with her this past winter break in a manner not unlike how we acted when we were together, the gap between break up and reconciliation resembling a long distance relationship visitation interval. Naturally, I felt not unlike an exclusive partner and so I felt my testosterone flare up when threatened by this other. I don't typically feel this way (especially when the incriminating comments in question are this innocuous) so perhaps there was another feeling I'm still unaware at play. At any rate, as I got the dopamine release from acknowledging the source of my short-lived jealousy and coming to terms with its silliness, I told my roommate about it.

He had been sitting next to me the whole time that I was obsessing over this anonymous person's feed but it was only after I achieved this resolution that I was comfortable enough telling him. I told him I found both phenomena amusing: my unwarranted territorialness and the latency between that feeling's start and my sharing it. Of course by the time I had told him, most of the tension had be resolved, defeating the purpose.
