title: On Rooms' Architecture
published: false
---
I promised myself I'd write about the architecture for *Rooms* this summer but a semester after and here I am with only 3 published posts and a handful more. I figured I'd try writing an evolving article detailing not just my architecture but the reasoning and learning behind the development of *Rooms* like all those cool kids working at the cool companies with their cool dev blogs. I also figure if something is particularly annoying to understand or set up I could create tutorials out of them instead of contriving instructional blog posts.

## How It Started

My friend Michael approached me a semester and summer ago with an idea for the [C3 Innovation Grant](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/university-senate/membership/councils/student-senators-council/campus-coding-collaborative.html). He was painfully aware of the far-too numerous study room-hosting buildings on campus and their different, disparately located reservation apps. 

He suggested a simple web frontend that just called the APIs.

Riding the energy of my then increasing autonomy and comfort with my project at NYU STIT, [Print Status](http://status.print.nyu.edu) I was interested in a more all-encompassing solution for students - something I'd want to use myself.

At the time I was quite obsessive about React - I'd been devouring Medium articles left and right even though I hadn't coded anything in it for some time. I became enamored with the idea of a Progressive Web App and how easy Create-React-App made building that - so my first suggestion was making the front end something usable for mobile and desktop users. Also - nobody has time for multiple code bases and app store updates.

Eventually we created a mvp for the project using none of the tech stack and are in the process of the final stage of the grant, but I decided, with Michael's blessing, to donate the project to my team so I could work on it in a fuller capacity with the support of a dedicated front end engineer and UX designer.

But between then and now, I've solidified the tech stack for the final product.

## The Stack

- Progressive Web App powered by React
- API Gateway + AWS Lambda trivialized by Serverless Framework
- DynamoDB
- CloudWatch + Grafana for metrics 
- CodePipeline for CDCI

## Designing

The flip side of complete autonomy and creative freedom is lack of guidance and choice paralysis. But it's an exciting coin to flip either way!

I wanted to create an app the provided the following services:
- Reserve a room at any accessible location on campus
- Automatically exclude locations for which the student wasn't authorized to use (like Law Library rooms) without forcing the authorized students to use two - or more - apps
- Remember past and current reservations
- Provide a simply *better* experience for students
- Offer crowd-sourced data on the amenities available to a specific room
- Gather metrics for cool inferences for NYU!

To design the frontend I used a much lauded gem - [Figma](https://www.figma.com). I love this app so much. I have yet to convince our UX team to forego their years of experience with and wealth of plugins for Sketch so far but watch out! My excitement for WebAssembly can wait for another time.

I wanted to break out of NYU purple and some of the more sterile designs of our existing canonical web content. The current design ended up being more 'sexy' or 'modern' and less friendly or academic. I'm working with our designer to audit the whole thing and see where it can be made more friendly. Said poor designer is also responsible for generating wider width designs but Figma makes [responsive design a breeze](https://blog.figma.com/5-essential-ways-to-use-design-constraints-29fb21cbcf40).

I toyed with a few variations of the loading/landing page.

The center symbol/image is meant to rotate as the app loads. Hopefully they shouldn't for long.

I wanted to evoke Bobst so I took an old photo from the design spec of Bobst's floor plan from the original designer's webpage... I think - I don't remember anymore. I might have to take an actual photo of the floor if I end up doing this design.

And a very pretentious icon

![Rooms (4).png](..\images\post_images\Rooms (4).png)

The home page demonstrates the two most important features from above plus another (with its own endpoint): an immediate 'gimme a room now' feature that uses the location of the agent. Alexa supports location thru its Device Address API so all the better!

![Rooms (5).png](..\images\post_images\Rooms (5).png)

I've also designed a search page first draft. As it stands it's cluttered and could afford smaller type and icons.

It supports a list view but I need (to delegate to our designer) to design a time table and map view. The latter is a feature requested by everyone I talk to about this app and seems an intuitive choice but I suspect given the mutual proximity of the buildings at NYU's Washington Square and Brooklyn campuses (campi?) that it may end up useless. The metrics will tell I suppose.

You may notice >2 fonts in use. I apologize. They will be squashed as the designs are finalized! 

In designing this I tried to create a vocabulary to uniquely identify the app - this has manifested mostly in the Periodic Table icons for the buildings. After many iterations I decided I quite like the idea of a two letter identifier for each building based on what I call a *Shortcode* - I've defined a way to name each building at NYU with a five letter ID. The rules for this derivation are detailed such that future developers or developers elsewhere could easily create their own. From this shortcode the first and last letters are used to create the 'Periodic' id. Other aesthetic considerations were trying to marry flat design and Material design but since one is inspired by the other I guess it's  just inspired by the latter.

You may also notice the list of amenities in the 'Filter' dropdown  - how these work logically will be detailed in the backend section and how they're collected will be similarly described in the frontend section.

## Frontend

I discussed the motivations behind PWAs above. They're just awesome. I don't think the app as of yet necessitates a data store and we can probably get away with just passing everything as props but perhaps after a discussion with our designer that may change. As I've taken over backend duties our frontend engineer can take care of the executive decisions here.

One thing I haven't designed yet is a feedback page and amenities vote section. I want a way for users to vote on amenities (from a list that we create) present in a given room. 

Alexa Skills are essentially lambda functions so I design my backend right it shouldn't be hard to create a Skill making use of the existing ones.

## Backend

Following the advice of my friend Cris I realized that I could have more fun learning a completely new paradigm of backend development - serverless. More specifically, *Serverless*... Framework (*tough crowd*).

I decided on AWS Lambda to:
- Save money for my team
- Enable easy Alexa integration
- Challenge myself to think around a new paradigm of backend architecture
- Create a needlessly scalable service (for similar reasons to above)

At this point in time I realize that by using Serverless to abstract away API Gateway, Cloudformation and deployment defeats some of the purpose but I've done a few tutorials on manually setting up REST APIs and my team's funding is a function of how many buzzwords we can pitch so all is not lost!

I was considering MongoDB but past traumatic experiences with pages-long tutorials and hours-long attempts at running MDB on AMI have taught me to just concede defeat and buy into the convenience of Cloudformation and AWS's convenient web console for DDB. I mean, deploying DDB straight from the serverless.yml??? 

I'm going to have to learn around DDB's fairly idiosyncratic key/indexing system but their docs are pretty nice about it. Querying/scanning seems less intuitive than what my experience with MDB + Mongoose indicated for that stack but perhaps there is a better wrapper for DDB on Node than AWS SDK's built in [DocumentClient](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/DynamoDB/DocumentClient.html).

I also don't want to formally learn SQL so that's why I'm not using RDS or any SQL.

## DevOps

*gasp!* Another buzzword?!

From what I understand, DevOps refers to a mentality or paradigm in bridging traditional _Ops_ or deployment roles and Development ones. It also refers to specific individuals at companies who manage this sort of thing? I'm not sure but I see a lot of job openings for "DevOps Engineers" so idk. 

In any case it seems like DevOps methodologies have merit and revolve around automating a lot of the 'fun' parts of software deployment like managing server compute instances, uploading codebases to said instances and setting up db connections, etc.

What implementing DevOps ideas into this project means is just CD CI and the various steps along that route. What my DevOps flow/stack looks like is this:

- Business logic is 'modular' (*read: abusing dependency injections*)
- Unit tests everywhere
- Coverage to shame developers (*read: me*) who haven't written tests for their commits
- Linting to enforce a Singular Vision of Indentation&trade;, among other things
- Git hooks to reject commits for the above reasons 
- CodePipeline to essentially run `$serverless deploy`  when the commit pushes, depending on the branch in question

Now I can write my business logic (+ tests) and everything is automated for me! Yay! T'was quite the pain in the ass setting it up.
