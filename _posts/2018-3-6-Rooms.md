title: On Rooms' Architecture
published: false
---
I promised myself I'd write about the architecture for *Rooms* this summer but a semester later and here I am with only 3 published posts and a handful more sitting in the repo. I figured then I'd try writing an evolving article detailing not just my architecture but the reasoning and learning behind the development of *Rooms* like all those cool kids working at the cool companies with their cool dev blogs.

I figure this could also form an informal basis for my big picture documentation down the line.

## How It Started

My friend Michael approached me a semester and summer ago with an idea for the [C3 Innovation Grant](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/university-senate/membership/councils/student-senators-council/campus-coding-collaborative.html). He suggested a simple web frontend that just called the APIs of various buildings' room reservation apps. 

Riding the high of the increasing autonomy and energy of my projects with NYU STIT was interested in a more all-encompassing solution for students - something I'd want to use myself.

## The Stack

- Progressive Web App powered by React
- API Gateway + AWS Lambda trivialized by Serverless Framework
- DynamoDB
- CloudWatch + Grafana for metrics 
- CodePipeline for CDCI

## Designing

I wanted to create an app the provided the following services:
- Reserve a room at any accessible location on campus
- Automatically exclude locations for which the student wasn't authorized to use (like Law Library rooms) without forcing the authorized students to use two - or more - apps
- Remember past and current reservations
- Offer crowd-sourced data on the amenities available to a specific room
- Gather metrics for cool inferences for NYU!

To design the frontend I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

I wanted to break out of NYU purple and some of the more sterile designs of our existing canonical web content. As a result I ended up trying to go for a 'sleek' or 'modern' design. I'm working with our designer to see where it can be made more friendly. I've found that _Material_ designs can really make flat designs more accessible.

Said poor designer is also responsible for generating wider width designs but Figma makes [responsive design a breeze](https://blog.figma.com/5-essential-ways-to-use-design-constraints-29fb21cbcf40).

I toyed with a few variations of the loading/landing page:

![Rooms.png](..\images\post_images\Rooms.png)

The center symbol/image is meant to rotate as the app loads. Hopefully they shouldn't rotate for long.

  ![Rooms2.png](..\images\post_images\Rooms2.png)

I wanted to evoke Bobst so I took an old photo from the design spec of Bobst's floor plan from the original designer's webpage... I think - I don't remember anymore. I might have to take an actual photo of the floor if we end up doing this design.

![Rooms3.png](..\images\post_images\Rooms3.png)

And a somewhat pretentious icon:

![Rooms4.png](..\images\post_images\Rooms4.png)

The home page demonstrates the two most important features from above plus another (with its own endpoint): an immediate 'gimme a room now' feature that uses the location of the agent. Conveniently, Alexa supports location thru its Device Address API!

![Rooms5.png](..\images\post_images\Rooms5.png)

I've also designed a search page first draft. Currently it's cluttered and could afford smaller type, icons and more whitespace.

It supports a list view but I need (_to delegate to our designer_) to design a time table and map view. The latter is a feature requested by everyone I talk to about and seems an intuitive choice but I suspect given the mutual proximity of the buildings at NYU's Washington Square and Brooklyn campuses (campi?) that it may end up useless. The proof will be in the metrics!

You may notice >2 fonts in use. I apologize. They will be squashed as the designs are finalized.

In designing this I tried to create a vocabulary to uniquely identify the app - this has manifested mostly in the Periodic Table iconography for the buildings. After many iterations I decided I quite like the idea of a two letter identifier for each building based on what I call a *Shortcode* - I've defined a way to name each building at NYU with a five letter ID. The rules for this derivation are detailed such that future devs or maintainers could easily create their own. From this Shortcode the first and last letters are used to create the 'Periodic' id. Other aesthetic considerations were trying to marry flat design and Material design but since one is inspired by the other I guess it's just inspired by the latter.

You may also notice the list of amenities in the 'Filter' dropdown  - how these work logically will be detailed in the backend section and how they're collected will be described in the frontend section.

## Frontend

I discussed the motivations behind PWAs above. They're just awesome. I don't think the app as of yet necessitates a data store and we can probably get away with just passing everything as props but perhaps after a discussion with our designer that may change. As I've taken over backend duties our frontend engineer can take care of the executive decisions here.

One thing I haven't designed yet is a feedback page and amenities vote section. I want a way for users to vote on amenities (from a list that we create) present in a given room, perhaps after the reservation date is passed we can offer a feedback modal during the user's next reservation success or as a feedback button for each room in the "past reservations" review. 

Alexa Skills are essentially lambda functions so if I design my backend right it shouldn't be hard to create a Skill making use of the existing ones.

## Backend

Following the advice of a friend I realized that I could have more fun learning a completely new paradigm of backend development - serverless. More specifically, *Serverless*... Framework.

I decided on AWS Lambda to:
- Save money for my team
- Enable easy Alexa integration
- Challenge myself to think around a new paradigm of backend architecture
- Create a needlessly scalable service (for similar reasons to above)

At this point in time I realize that by using Serverless to abstract away API Gateway and Cloudformation defeats some of the purpose but I'm having fun learning about the underlying tech anyways!

I'm using DDB because it fits easily with AWS and Cloudformation/Serverless Resources without much config and I haven't used it in a prod env yet.

<!-- talk about vandium, classes, structure and lengevity plans -->

One of my main goals for this project is to decouple the infrustructure and business logic from the WSQ campus and the existing locations here - meaning I want this to be extensible easily for future devs here and for devs at the other NYU campuses if needed. It's also a challenge in software design to be as modular and future proof as possible.

I'm using Webpack+Babel to transpile from es7 to es5. I find it weird that I've become used to the (syntactically) hacky nature of promises to handle async functions so I welcome async/await as a way to return to more conventional try/catch logic. I am otherwise dependent on => functions and Classes so in conclusion, the future is now with Babel!

I'm using [Vandium](https://github.com/vandium-io/vandium-node) which is a handy "framework" (but feels more like a lib) for simplifying some of the more boilerplate Lambda NodeJS logic.

### Class structures

Essentially all locations need to provide the exact same functionality as far as I'm concerned - I just need to reconcile the differences in their APIs and their responses. This is naturally conducive to an OOP structure. There are no interfaces in JS and I'm not using TS. Why? I don't know it and haven't bothered to learn yet.

We can consider that every location must comply to the following requirements:

- We can list available rooms/roomTimes
- We can search for specific rooms
- We can reserve rooms

All this requires standardizing the following (or creating Models for):

- Rooms
- RoomTimes
- Reservation Requests
- Reservations (there's a way to combine this and the above)
- Locations

***What is a roomTime?***

Since we're concerned with reserving rooms for a temporary period our concerns are both temporal and spatial - this necessitates a model that represents a room during a specific time period. Thus each room has many roomTimes associated with it. 

**We face a problem** - not every location requires the same reservation request parameters. For example, some of the schools require a minimum of 2 occupants and their email addresses in addition to the reserver's. LaGuardia Coop's reservation system requires full name, current year standing, email address, NetID and how the reserver found out about the Coop.

> A somewhat interesting aside, the Coop actually uses Google Calendars for each room under the hood to manage actual occupancies - meaning we can circumvent the scheduling system (*ScheduleOnce*) and directly modify the underlying GCal, with permission. In fact, we *are* doing this. I will detail this shortly.

Anyways, Bobst doesn't require that info. But Bobst *does* requires the user to be logged in to view or reserve rooms whereas the Coop doesn't. 

To implement this stuff the service can return the fields required + descriptions when the location endpoint is hit and the client can dynamically create the appropriate form fields (or Alexa prompts) in turn. To reduce the number of questions the user is asked everytime they reserve I'm considering a *post-first-login* questionnaire that asks certain common questions that remain static between reservations (email address, full name, etc). This questionnaire is reduced by grabbing info from our auth server (**Shibboleth**) which provides a lot of good stuff like year standing, school (within NYU), diploma (postgrad vs. grad vs. undergrad) etc. It may even make said questionnaire irrelevant, but this I will find out once I can see the questions asked and the details offered by Shibboleth. 

On the topic of the Calendar based scheduling systems, my boss at STIT tells me there are apparently many GCal-based study room reservation systems. Even if this were incorrect, the rooms at the Coop (one GCal per room) suffice as motivation to create a class for GCal based rooms. From my experience with the Coop's GCal (which I was graciously allowed Read access to for research) I found that only occupations were listed, in 1 hour multiples. That means I have to create *virtual* roomTimes starting from the opening hours till closing for each day starting from "now" to 2 weeks on from then. This necessitates a VirtualRoomTime child class from the RoomTime with builtin methods for handling this emulation logic.

### Database

Our schemas revolve around the models detailed above. The exception being that we're not interested in past or existing reservations as data but rather only for metrics. We do keep individual user's reservations under their entries for the User views. 

Our Location classes will contain information about their corresponding DB entries but we can assume the default corresponding entry PrimaryKey will be the shortcode.

As I started writing the DB interface I was being overly enthused about dependency injections for unit tests so I created a few layers of classes to abstract the DB completely, in case we decide to change our db of choice later. Why would we do such a thing and how likely is it? I don't know, and probably not at all. But I already went thru all the trouble so I'll take care of the superfluous code later. Famous last words?  

### Authentication

NYU offers OIDC and SAML for auth but I need stateless session so OIDC it is. Also as an apparent benefit, OIDC doesn't require MFA - at least for the time being - so I can do automated endpoint testing.

## DevOps

Buzzword!

From what I understand, DevOps refers to a mentality or paradigm in bridging traditional _Ops_ or deployment roles and Development ones. It also refers to specific individuals at companies who manage this sort of thing? I'm not sure but I see a lot of job openings for "DevOps Engineers" so idk. 

In any case it seems like DevOps methodologies have merit and revolve around automating a lot of the fun parts of software deployment like managing server compute instances, uploading codebases to said instances and setting up db connections, etc /s.

What implementing DevOps ideas into this project means is just CD CI and the various steps along that route. What my DevOps flow/stack looks like is this:

- Business logic is 'modular' (*read: abusing dependency injections*)
- Unit tests everywhere
- Coverage to shame developers (*read: me*) who haven't written tests for their commits
- Linting to enforce a Singular Vision of Indentation&trade;, among other things
- Git hooks to reject commits for the above reasons 
- CodePipeline to essentially run `$serverless deploy`  when the commit pushes, depending on the branch in question
	- More specifics about Codebuild and endpoint testing should be in the readme of the repo by the time you read this

Now I can write my business logic (+ tests) and everything is automated for me!
