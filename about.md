I study Computer Science and Philosophy at NYU.

I like to write poetry/lyrics.

I spend a lot of time composing and producing music.

I spend a lot of time coding.

I spend a lot of time writing.

I waste a lot of time thinking about motivation and time management.
I spend a lot of time thinking about personal development, self esteem, masculinity, ethics and empowering myself and my friends.

I like to look at people's outfits.

### Calling all collaborators

If you make art I need album covers

If you do UX I need interface design feedback

If you make games I have a game engine that needs completion

If you make web apps I have a ton of lil apps that need collaborators

If you sing indie pop I have a lil indie pop EP coming out

If you play instruments I have of lot of technical metal that needs session partners


Please say hi and let's do cool stuff together
