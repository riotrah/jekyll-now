# Hello

This my blog. I started it out hoping to get some long form writing out of the way but as life and more interesting projects have me in their grips I'll instead be posting snippets of my thoughts, with no guarantee that any post will ever be finished or even well-organized.

I study Computer Science and Philosophy at NYU. I was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh to a diplomat household. I've spent every couple of years of my life in a different city: Dhaka > Paris > NYC > Dhaka > Geneva > NYC. The last being my most permanent stop, where I went to high school right on Houston and Columbia - only a couple blocks away from where I write this.

One day I'll generate Tool's next album myself using some of the ML I've learned, but till then, I'll be aiming in that direction as I make music of various sorts and build software in various roles.
