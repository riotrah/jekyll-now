I like RnB and funky hip hop (20%).
I like progressive metal (70%).
I like good ol' rock and roll (10%).

I spend a lot of time coding.
I like javascript.
I'm starting to not like javascript as much.
I don't like java.
I'm starting to like java more.
I like the web.
I like cloud computing and thinking about confusing architecture.
I like graphic design.

I waste a lot of time thinking about motivation and time management.
I spend a lot of time thinking about personal development, self esteem, masculinity, ethics and empowering myself and my friends.

I like fashion and pretend to dress well sometimes.

### Calling all collaborators

If you make art I need album covers

If you do UX I need interface design feedback

If you make games I have a game engine that needs completion

If you make web apps I have a ton of lil apps that need collaborators

If you sing indie pop I have a lil indie pop EP coming out

If you play instruments I have of lot of technical metal that needs session partners


Please say hi and let's do cool stuff together
